### Identify Customer Segmentation for Arvato Financial Services

# Project Overview
In this project, I analyzed demographics data for customers of a mail-order sales company in Germany, comparing it against demographics information for the general population. I used unsupervised learning techniques to perform customer segmentation, identifying the parts of the population that best describe the core customer base of the company. Then used several ML model to predict which individuals are most likely to convert into becoming customers for the company.
